# My Art Portfolio
I'm someone who likes to code his own personal websites from scratch because I can. Sure, services like WordPress and Wix are open to me - but those aren't as fun as building from the ground up. I like having control over every little aspect of my code instead of arguing with templates given to me by hosting services. This is especially true for a site like this. 

Here is where you will find all the code for my art portfolio.

I'm not sure how much info I'll need to give to this README file. So for now I'll leave it as is.
